With the help of a young construction laborer  Ram  they steal material from a construction site  build a tree-house in order to spy on him - a process that ends up in friendship. Things take a turn for the worst when a builder  Bakshi  asks his assistant  Gupta  to cut the tree down. The children object but are told that this action has been approved by the local government. The question remains: What can the children do - especially when they face opposition from their parents  and that Bakshi has not only made a donation to their society but also has Raavan arrested - in the state of Maharashtra that has set a near dubious record of cutting over Eleven Lakh Thirty Thousand trees in a five year period (2002-2007).",
