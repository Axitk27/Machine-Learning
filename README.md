Machine Learning Journey Repository
This repository, created by Axit Kakadiya, documents my Machine Learning journey. Here, you will find all the books I am studying and the projects I plan to complete over the course of one year.

I am currently following the CampusX Machine Learning course as part of this learning path, and this repository will be regularly updated with my progress, notes, and project implementations.

Contents
Books — Notes, summaries, and key takeaways from machine learning books.

Projects — Hands-on projects covering various ML topics and techniques.

Course Material — Resources and assignments from the CampusX course.
